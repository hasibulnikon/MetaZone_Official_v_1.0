"""
session.py — Stage 4: the real Meta Generator pipeline, ported to run
behind the JS bridge instead of behind Tk widgets.

This is a deliberate PORT, not a rewrite: the actual generation logic
(prompt building, call_with_failover, parsing, sanitization, the
undercount-keyword retry, prefix/suffix application) is copied
line-for-line in intent from ui/main_window.py's `_gen_thread` /
`process_one`, calling the exact same unmodified engine/core functions.
What's different is only the UI-facing seam: instead of
`self._ui_action_queue.put(lambda: card.apply_result(...))`, this
module calls `bridge.emit(...)`, and instead of CTkImage thumbnails,
`make_thumb_b64` produces a plain base64 PNG for an `<img>` tag.

Card-render rules carried over unchanged (see project knowledge doc):
- A path never gets a card while "waiting"/"working" -- only once
  "done"/"failed" (see `_results` status transitions below).
- Cards render in completion order; `completion_order` is append-only,
  exactly like main_window.py's `_completion_order`.

    v0.9.1 bugfix: this is the actual root cause of the Embed page's
    "auto-import the CSV from Meta Generator" not working for some
    installs. core.config._common_pref_dir() points at a fixed
    C:\\MetaZone on Windows (see core/config.py) -- writable for most
    users, but not guaranteed (e.g. a standard/non-admin account where
    that folder hasn't already been created with permissive ACLs).
    Previously, only a failure of the *import itself* fell back to a
    temp directory; a failure of the actual os.makedirs() call below
    (permissions, read-only drive, etc.) just returned None with no
    fallback at all -- so _write_working_csv() silently never ran,
    self.last_csv_path stayed None, and clicking Embed on Meta
    Generator would switch pages but find nothing to load, with only
    a small, easy-to-miss status-line error explaining why. Now falls
    back to the OS temp directory (same one core.config.get_prefs_path
    already falls back to for the exact same reason) on ANY failure
    creating the primary location, not just an import error, so the
    working CSV -- and therefore the Embed auto-import -- keeps
    working even when C:\\MetaZone isn't writable."""

    v0.9.8 fix: vector (.ai/.eps/.svg) and video (.mp4/.mov) files
    used to always return None here -- no attempt was ever made to
    render them, so the import grid showed a blank cell for every one
    of them. This now tries a REAL preview for each (Ghostscript/
    PyMuPDF for vector via vector.renderer, a real decoded ffmpeg
    frame for video) and only returns None -- letting the frontend
    fall back to its file-type placeholder -- when that real render
    genuinely fails (missing Ghostscript/ffmpeg, corrupt file, etc.).
    Never fabricates a preview.

    v0.9.6: `is_stale` (optional zero-arg callable) is forwarded to
    the vector/video renderers so a Clear-All/newer-import mid-render
    actually terminates the Ghostscript/ffmpeg child instead of only
    being checked between files (see core/cancellable_subprocess.py
