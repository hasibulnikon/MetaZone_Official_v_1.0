"""Prompt-to-Prompt Generator engine.

Takes one existing prompt and generates N new variations inspired by it.
Text-only (no image), so this reuses call_with_failover with path=None
(see engine/ai_providers.py) — the same failover/key-rotation engine
Standard/Smart Workflow use, never a duplicate implementation.

Large counts are split into batches (one AI call each) run through the
app's existing bounded worker pool, both for real progress feedback and
so a single oversized request doesn't risk truncation/low quality.
