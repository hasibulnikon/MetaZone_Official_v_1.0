"""Vector analyzer router.

Detects the REAL format of an uploaded vector file (not just by file
extension -- .ai files are checked for a real PDF header before being
treated as PDF-compatible) and routes to the correct real reader:

  .svg              -> svg_structure.parse_svg_structure (always real)
  .ai (PDF-based)    -> ai_pdf_structure.parse_ai_pdf_structure (real)
  .ai (legacy)/.eps  -> ps_structure.parse_ps_header (real, limited)

Also produces a real raster preview for the AI visual-analysis step,
using the renderer that matches the format actually detected.

STRUCTURE READ FAILURES ARE FATAL (we genuinely can't say anything real
about a file we can't parse). RENDER FAILURES ARE NOT -- a real report
from the field: Ghostscript can fail with a DLL version mismatch on a
given Windows machine even when correctly installed (multiple
Ghostscript versions/DLLs on one system is a known, common conflict).
Rather than losing the whole file over a rendering problem, this
returns (structure, None, render_error) so the caller can fall back to
a text-only AI call using the real structural/header facts alone.
