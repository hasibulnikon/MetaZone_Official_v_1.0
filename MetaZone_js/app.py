MetaZone v0.8 — pywebview shell entry point (Stage 3-7 batches).

This launches a native OS webview (WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on
Linux) pointed at frontend/index.html, with `backend.bridge.Api`
exposed to it as `pywebview.api`.

Resource resolution handles both dev mode (running `python app.py`
from source) and a PyInstaller-frozen build: when frozen, PyInstaller
extracts --add-data bundles to sys._MEIPASS at runtime, so BASE_DIR
points there instead of this file's directory.

# imports exactly as they do in the original app -- zero changes
# needed to any copied business-logic file. This works identically
# frozen or not, since backend/ is bundled as plain data (--add-data)
# and imported by path at runtime rather than relying on PyInstaller's
# static import analysis to discover it.

    """v0.9.8: '--diag' CLI flag -- prints a plain dependency report
    (ExifTool/FFmpeg/ffprobe/Ghostscript found or not, and from where)
    and exits, without opening any window. Added specifically so the
    GitHub Actions Windows build (.github/workflows/build_js.yml) can
    actually verify a freshly-built EXE finds its bundled binaries,
    instead of the build being 'untested' beyond 'PyInstaller didn't
    error and a .exe file exists'. Exits 1 if anything expected to be
    bundled is missing (a real packaging bug worth failing CI over);
    prints to stdout either way so a human can also just run
    'MetaZone.exe --diag' themselves to see what's wrong.

    Also writes the same report to a 'metazone_diag.txt' file next to
    the running exe (or the script, in dev mode): this build is
    `--windowed` (no console subsystem), so plain stdout from a
    launched .exe is not reliably visible to a CI step that just
    invokes it -- the file guarantees the CI log can show real output
    either way, not just the exit code.

    Deliberately called (see the bottom of this block) BEFORE `import
    webview`, `from bridge import Api, ...`, PIL/sqlite3, etc. This
    used to run after all of those, which meant an unrelated import
    failure anywhere in that much larger chain (bridge.py alone pulls
    in session.py, embedder.py, engine/ai_providers.py, automation/*,
    dashboard.py...) would crash the process with a bare traceback
    before '--diag' ever got a chance to run -- exiting non-zero and
    writing no report at all, which looked identical to a real
    'dependency not found' failure in CI logs but was actually a
    totally separate bug. Only os/sys and the two lightweight
    core.utils/core.bin_finder modules (pure stdlib + PIL) are needed
    for the four checks below, so --diag no longer depends on webview,
    pywebview's renderer detection, or any backend module actually

# That's fine on a 1920x1080+ screen, but on a smaller/lower-res
# monitor -- 1366x768 being the explicit "gold standard" older-monitor
# floor this needs to support -- a window requested at 900px tall
# either gets clipped by the taskbar or forces the OS to reposition
# it, and the fixed-pixel UI reads as oversized relative to the
# smaller screen. Two-part fix, deliberately split this way so the

# already fits (i.e. exactly the app's current look on a normal
# 1080p+ display is untouched):

#      can comfortably hold, scaled down proportionally for smaller
